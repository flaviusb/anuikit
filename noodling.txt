An example of bits

Windows

- Splits/Merges
- Chrome
- Decoration/glyphs on the window, in chrome

Statusline/command bar
- Supports whatever mode stuff for editing

Visual select

Command completion/application programmability exposed through command bar and scripting interfaces

Scripting language

Reified objects that users and code can interact with, whose status is reflected in the windowing toolkit, rather than direct ad hoc changes being made to the chrome/flash.
- Focus model, which user input and applications can change and query in various ways, and which directs user input to processes and is visualised in gui state.
- Notifications, which interacts with focus model (and settings object), and replaces the ad hoc 'status bar'.
- Settings, where all applications can store their settings, so you have one place to edit them.
- App statuses - number of new messages (possibly sorted into different mailboxes), saved/unsaved document status, cwd equivalent, tethering, 'busy' / 'working' / 'heavy processing' state, 'waiting for input' (which also interacts with Focus), network status (both reporting and setting, in different ways, but also things like GiTS 'autistic mode' (come up with a less nt name)), chroot/permissions/etc status (which also interacts with settings), remote/casting/client-server in the case where there is some client/server thing going on, like in x11 network transparency, so that you don't untether something and have your apps crash, but also these work in different ways and you should be able to find out what the exact kind is from window flair...
